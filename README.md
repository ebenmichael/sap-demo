# SAP Notebook Demo
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ebenmichael/sap-demo/master


In this minimal demo, we look at a PDF document of an SAP for [A randomised trial to increase the uptake of smoking cessation services using
Personal Targeted risk information and Taster Sessions](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/start2quit/pdf_files/statistical-analysis-plan). A portion of this PDF document (Section 2.1) is converted into a notebook which contains the same written work, but is augmented with R code that runs the analyses described.
